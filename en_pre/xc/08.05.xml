The cottage visitors made a bet about whether they could drop their weight by 10% during seven weeks. Make a program that asks for the original weight and tells what should be the weight at the end of each week so that the general goal would be reached.
<ul>
<li>The idea of the code <br />
function showWeightGoals() { <br />
    read the original weight to a variable <br />
    calculate how many kgs one should get lighter each week = weight * 0.1 / 7<br />
    initialize output text variable to start from empty text: "" <br />
    it will be used later to gather all the output lines. (String can hold also line breaks) <br />
    
    for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 7; i++) { <br />
     	give the weight variable a new value which is weight after last <br />
        measurement reduced by the how much to lose this week. <br />
        add this week’s text + line break to the output text variable <br /> 
    } <br />
    
    write the whole output text to the HTML page at once <br />
}</li>
<li>Call the  showWeightGoals() function from the "Show weight goals" button’s onclick event</li>
</ul>
