<exercise title="02.03 BMI using Blocklies" difficulty="medium" size="XL" returnbox="http://hhmoodle.haaga-helia.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=400426&amp;action=editsubmission">

<p class="exercise_text"> 
Please create a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator using Blocklies. The BM-index is calculated with the formula: BMI = weight in kilograms / (height in meters * height in meters). So e.g. if you weigh 70 kilograms and you are 1.8 meters tall, then your BMI is 70 / (1.8 * 1.8) = 22</p>
<p>Your application first asks the user for his name, then for his weight and height. Then it shows a message telling: "Hi name! Your body mass index is x"</p>

<p></p>From this URL you can find all the blocks youÂ´ll need for creating the application:

<p>Here is a video instructions:<a href="https://youtu.be/Od_wHc7_kT0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Od_wHc7_kT0</a></p>
</p>
<p>
Please submit a link to your ready application. 
</p>
<p>After you have finished, feel free to explore with blocklies by creating e.g. a quiz application that will ask the user for questions and determine how many answers he got right. Hint: You will need at least the "If"-block for this application.
