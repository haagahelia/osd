<p class="exercise_text"> 
The cottage visitors made a bet about whether they could drop their weight by 10% during seven weeks. Make a program that asks for the original weight and tells what should be the weight at the end of each week so that the general goal would be reached.
</p>
<p class="exercise_gui_title">Sample output for shown input:</p>
<p><img src="xc/08.05.png" class="bordered"/>
</p>
<p>HINTS:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Call the  showWeightGoals() function from the "Show weight goals" button’s onclick event</li>
<li>The idea of the code
<pre><code>
function showWeightGoals() { 
    // read the original weight to a variable 
    // calculate how many kgs one should get lighter each week = weight * 0.1 / 7
    // initialize output text variable to start from empty text: "" 
    // it will be used later to gather all the output lines. (String can hold also line breaks) 
    
    // for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 7; i++) { 
     	// give the weight variable a new value which is weight after last
        // measurement reduced by the how much to lose this week.
        // add this week’s text + line break to the output text variable 
    } <br />
    
    // write the whole output text to the HTML page at once 
}</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit a link to your code (myy or jsbin). </p>
