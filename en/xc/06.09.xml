		If a car driver speeds no more than 20 km/h over the speed limit, the
		driver will avoid the income-based unit fines (päiväsakot), and gets
		just the infraction fine (rikesakko). Make a program that tells how
		much the infraction fine is. It’s based on the speed limit and the
		excess speed. The program asks for the driving speed and the speed
		limit. If there is speeding the ticket will be decided upon based on
		the following rules:
		<ul>
			<li>If the speed limit is <b>10-60</b> kilometers an hour, and the excess
				speed is no more than <b>15 km/h</b>, the speeding leads into a <b>85</b>-euro
				infraction fine (rikesakko). More than 15 but no more than 20 km/h
				leads into an infraction fine of <b>115</b> euros.</li>
			<li>If the speed limit is <b>70-120</b> kilometers an hour, a max <b>15 km/h</b>
				speeding will be penalizes with <b>70</b>-euro infraction fine. The
				infraction fine is <b>100</b> euros when the excess speed is more than 15
				km/h, but no more than 20 km/h. </li>
			<li>(If the driver drives <b>more than 20 km/h</b> over the limit => he will
				get unit fines, päiväsakot).</li>
		</ul>
