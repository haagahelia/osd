<i>A dialog box is a small temporary window an application creates to display information or request user input. Modal dialog boxes temporarily halt the program until the user closes the dialog. Modal dialog boxes are created, perform their task, and are destroyed by calling a single function</i>
</p>
<p> 
The <b>alert()</b> method displays a modal dialog box with a specified message, along with an <b>OK</b> button. Example: <pre><code>alert("An early bird gets the worm!")</code></pre>
</p>
 <p>
The <b>confirm()</b> method displays a modal confirm dialog box with a specified message, along with an <b>OK</b> and a <b>Cancel</b> button. The method returns <b>true</b> if the user clicked OK, otherwise the method returns <b>false</b>. Example: <pre><code>confirm("Do you really want to exit?")</code></pre>
</p>
 <p>
TASK: Make a program that displays a confirm dialog box with the text <b>"Do you want to continue?"</b> again and again until the user clicks the Cancel button in the dialog box. If the user clicks the OK button in the dialog box, then the program shows an alert dialog box with the text "Hello!". After the user has closed the alert dialog box the program shows the confirm dialog box again.
</p>
 <p>
HINT:  This time, you do not know beforehand how many times the confirm dialog box should be displayed. Therefore, write a while loop where you use the call to the method <b>confirm()</b> as the loop condition. The call to the method <b>alert()</b> should be in the loop body.
