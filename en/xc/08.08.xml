In a coin slot machine (One-handed robber) a game returns pay (money won) according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>The game will randomize dice pips between 1-6. You can randomize the pips with 
<pre><code> var pips = Math.round( (Math.random( ) * 5) + 1 ); </code></pre></li>
 <li>No pay if the randomized pips is 1, 3 or 5 </li>
 <li>The pips 2 and 4 return the set coins back 125% (=multiplied by 1.25) </li>
 <li>The pips 6 returns the inserted bet 150% </li>
 </ul>
      This algorithm was already done when we learned selection structures. 
      Letâ€™s reuse it now. <br />

Make a program with which the game firm can estimate the profits by test running the game multiple times.
The program asks how many rounds of the game will be run.
(Assume that the bet was 1 euro each time)
<ul>
<li>Make a loop which is executed as many times as was set through the input field. Randomize the pips and do the game logic during every round/iteration of the loop. Have a win counter cumulating the pays, and let the rounds run out.</li>
<li>Calculate the profit (euros) by subtracting the win counter (euros) from the bets (euros) </li>
</ul>
