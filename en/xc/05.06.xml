		A car driver (a motorist) was driving too fast. He drove 20 km/h over
		the speedlimit, so the police needed to fine him. Finnish unit fines (päiväsakot)
		are based on the net income of the driver. One fine unit (päiväsakko) can be
		calculated as: (net income - 255)/60.
		Create a program that tells how much is one fine unit for inputed net
		income.
		<ul>
			<li>Define a function that calculates the fine unit (euros) based on
				given net income (euros).</li>
			<li>Function call <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_number_methods.asp" target="_blank">toFixed(2)</a>
			 returns the value of a number rounded to
				two decimals</li>
		</ul>
