<p class="exercise_text"> 
The cottage guests were playing minigolf. Make a program that that tells the smallest (winner) and biggest (last one) results.The results for the eight players are in the array below: 
<pre><code>var minigolf = [23, 19, 37, 20, 21, 30, 26, 24];</code></pre> 
</p>
<p class="exercise_gui_title">Sample output:</p>
<p><img src="xc/09.04.png" class="bordered"/>
</p>
<p>HINTS:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Write the code into a script element inside of the body element</li>
<li>Sort the array with the sort() method. Then the smallest result is at the index 0.</li> 
<li>How to get the last item then? The length of the array is minigolf.length. Taking into consideration that indexes start from 0 and not from 1, what is the index of the last one? Use the minigolf.length in calculating the last index. Hint: With 3 items (length 3), indexes are 0,1,2. With 5 items (length 5) indexes are 0,1,2,3,4. How do you calculate the last index from the length property then, no matter what is the length?</li>
</ul>
